        <h1>This is supposed to be a page about me, Elise Bailey, but I mean... me and memes. Come on. It's only like 3 more letters.
        </h1>
        
        <p><h4>Unfortunately this is actually a school project, and therefore I actually have to be more or less serious with this.
        </p>
        
        <p>I'm not 100% sure what to write.</p>

<p>So I guess that means it's time to actually do something.</p>

<p>I think it should be noted that I'm actually doing this in the middle of class - when I should be working on an assesment that I've kinda done because of the original coding camp, that I am incidentally doing this "website" for.</p>

<p><h4> So anyway. My name's Elise, I'm 13, I'm a Kiwi... not really sure what else I want to put on the net tbh. I currently have pen all over my hands, I guess that's safe. Also I literally just downloaded this font, and so am praying I don't get a horrific virus. YOLO. I'mma type Taylor Swift 'cause this is "her" font. Ya know? Ooops I was using the wrong font.</p> </h4>
